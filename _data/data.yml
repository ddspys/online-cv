    info:
      - role: Data Scientist
        time: 2024 - 2024
        company: Zarathu, Seoul
        details: |
          For two months, I conducted a data scientist internship at Zarathu.
           During medical research, Zarathu is creating new value in medical
            research by designing and performing experimental methods or statistical
             techniques that are difficult for researchers to perform on their own.
              Here, I supported the writing of medical papers by generating models
               for predicting diseases through genetic mutations and interpreting their results.
                I also conducted survival analysis and analyzed clinical outcomes based
                 on data derived from clinical trials of new drugs.
